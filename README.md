## Introduction

Frigade is the easiest way for developers to build high-quality product onboarding and education.

## Install

#### With npm

```bash
npm install @frigade/react-onboarding-components
```

## Supercharge your onboarding flows
While the above examples contain hard-coded strings and images for illustrative purposes, we highly recommend loading your strings and presentation
layer logic from your API rather than as plain strings in your app.

We built [Frigade](https://frigade.com/) to work seamlessly with `react-onboarding-components` and make it easier for developers to build and scale onboarding. 
With Frigade, you can update onboarding flow without releasing to the app store, integrate 3rd party analytics (Segment, Mixpanel, etc.) to power user targeting, and integrate our API/webhooks to make user data input easy.
